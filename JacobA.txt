Hey there, my name is Jake Anderson. 
 
Three words to describe me:
1) Determined
2) Tenacious
3) Idealist

My favorite hobby would have to be music.  Playing music is great fun but I get most excited about composition.  I had spent some time in college years back in performance and recording. I think composition always interested me more because I always had an interest in creating something from nothing except an idea. I feel like that's where I bridge the gap between Full Stack Web Development and Music Composition:  I still get the ability to design and create.

Thanks for reading! ^_^
